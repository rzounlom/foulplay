# Football Card Rarity Research & Rebalancing Plan

## Research Summary: NFL Event Frequency Per Game

Based on NFL statistics and game analysis, here's the frequency categorization for football events:

### **VERY COMMON** (Happens 20-50+ times per game)
- **Incomplete Pass** - ~25-35 per game
- **QB throws the ball away** - ~5-10 per game  
- **Defensive Rebound** (if applicable)
- **Announcer phrases** - Very frequent

**Current Status**: These should be **mild** severity, **1 point**, **1 drink**

---

### **COMMON** (Happens 5-20 times per game)
- **False Start** - ~8-12 per game (most common penalty)
- **Holding Penalty** - ~6-10 per game
- **Delay of Game** - ~3-5 per game
- **Offside** - ~3-6 per game
- **Illegal Formation** - ~2-4 per game
- **Automatic First Down** - ~5-8 per game

**Current Status**: These should be **mild** severity, **1-2 points**, **1 drink**

---

### **MODERATE** (Happens 1-5 times per game)
- **Pass Interference** - ~2-4 per game (but significant impact)
- **Interception** - ~1-3 per game
- **Turnover** - ~2-4 per game
- **Sack** - ~2-5 per game
- **Fumble** - ~1-2 per game
- **Touchdown** - ~4-6 per game
- **Field Goal** - ~2-4 per game

**Current Status**: These should be **moderate** severity, **3-5 points**, **2 drinks** or **take a shot**

**Note**: Pass Interference is currently **mild** but should be **moderate** because:
- It's less frequent than false start/holding
- It has significant game impact (automatic first down + yardage)
- It's a more impactful penalty

---

### **RARE** (Happens 0.5-1 time per game on average)
- **Safety** - ~0.1-0.3 per game (very rare, ~1 per 3-5 games)
- **Pick-Six** (Interception returned for TD) - ~0.2-0.5 per game
- **Fumble Return TD** - ~0.1-0.3 per game
- **Hail Mary Completion** - ~0.1-0.2 per game
- **Onside Kick Recovery** - ~0.1-0.2 per game
- **2-Point Conversion** - ~0.5-1 per game
- **Overtime** - ~0.2-0.3 per game

**Current Status**: These should be **severe** severity, **6-8 points**, **shotgun** or **take 2 shots**

---

### **VERY RARE** (Happens <0.5 times per game, maybe once every few games)
- **Safety** - Actually very rare (~1 per 3-5 games)
- **Game-Winning Drive** - ~0.1-0.2 per game
- **Comeback Victory** - ~0.1-0.2 per game
- **Game-Ending Play** - ~0.1-0.2 per game
- **Hail Mary TD** - ~0.05-0.1 per game (very rare)

**Current Status**: These should be **severe** severity, **9-10 points**, **shotgun** or **everyone finishes drink**

---

## Proposed Rebalancing Plan

### Severity Distribution (Based on Rarity)

1. **Mild (60-70% of deck)** - Very Common & Common events
   - Points: 1-2
   - Penalty: "Take a drink"
   - Examples: Incomplete Pass, False Start, Holding, Delay of Game

2. **Moderate (20-30% of deck)** - Moderate frequency events
   - Points: 3-5
   - Penalty: "Take 2 drinks" or "Take a shot"
   - Examples: Pass Interference, Interception, Touchdown, Sack

3. **Severe (10-15% of deck)** - Rare & Very Rare events
   - Points: 6-10
   - Penalty: "Shotgun a beer" or "Take 2 shots" or "Everyone finishes drink"
   - Examples: Safety, Pick-Six, Game-Winning Drive, Hail Mary TD

---

## Specific Card Adjustments Needed

### Cards to Upgrade (Increase Severity/Points):

1. **Pass Interference** ⚠️ NEEDS UPGRADE
   - Current: **mild**, **1 point**, "Take a drink"
   - Should be: **moderate**, **3-4 points**, **"Take 2 drinks"**
   - Reason: Less frequent than false start/holding (~2-4 per game vs 8-12), but more impactful (automatic first down + yardage)

2. **Interception** ✅ CORRECT
   - Current: **moderate**, **4 points**, "Take a shot"
   - Status: Already correctly categorized

3. **Pick-Six** ⚠️ NEEDS UPGRADE
   - Current: **moderate**, **5 points**, "Take 2 drinks"
   - Should be: **severe**, **7-8 points**, **"Shotgun a beer"**
   - Reason: Much rarer than regular interception (~0.2-0.5 per game), game-changing play

4. **Safety** ⚠️ CONSIDER UPGRADE
   - Current: **severe**, **7 points**, "Shotgun a beer"
   - Should be: **severe**, **8-9 points**, "Shotgun a beer" (keep penalty, increase points)
   - Reason: Very rare (~1 per 3-5 games), huge game impact (2 points + possession)

5. **Fumble Return TD** ⚠️ NEEDS UPGRADE
   - Current: **moderate**, **5 points**, "Take 2 drinks"
   - Should be: **severe**, **7-8 points**, **"Shotgun a beer"**
   - Reason: Very rare (~0.1-0.3 per game), game-changing play

6. **Hail Mary Completion** ✅ CORRECT
   - Current: **severe**, **9 points**, "Everyone shotguns"
   - Status: Already correctly categorized (very rare)

7. **Hail Mary Attempt** ✅ CORRECT
   - Current: **mild**, **2 points**, "Take a drink"
   - Status: Correct - attempt is common, completion is rare

### Cards to Keep as Mild (Very Common):

- Incomplete Pass
- False Start
- Holding
- Delay of Game
- Offside
- QB throws away
- Announcer phrases

## Implementation Steps

1. **Categorize all 100 football cards** by actual game frequency
2. **Adjust severity levels** based on rarity
3. **Adjust point values** to match severity (rarer = more points)
4. **Adjust drink penalties** to match severity (rarer = steeper penalty)
5. **Ensure distribution**: ~60-70% mild, ~20-30% moderate, ~10-15% severe

---

## Priority Adjustments (Immediate Fixes)

### High Priority (Clear Misclassifications):
1. **Pass Interference**: mild → moderate (1 → 3-4 points)
2. **Pick-Six**: moderate → severe (5 → 7-8 points)
3. **Fumble Return TD**: moderate → severe (5 → 7-8 points)
4. **Safety**: Keep severe but increase points (7 → 8-9 points)

### Medium Priority (Review Needed):
- Review all "moderate" cards to ensure they're truly moderate frequency
- Review all "mild" cards to ensure common events aren't over-penalized
- Ensure rare events (Hail Mary, Safety, Pick-Six) are all severe

### Low Priority (Fine-tuning):
- Adjust point values within severity tiers for better balance
- Ensure penalty descriptions match severity appropriately

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Research complete - Document created
2. ⏳ Review all 100 football cards and assign frequency categories
3. ⏳ Recalculate severity, points, and penalties based on rarity
4. ⏳ Apply same research logic to basketball cards
5. ⏳ Update card definitions in `lib/game/cards.ts`
