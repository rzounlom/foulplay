# Basketball Card Rarity Research & Rebalancing Plan

## Research Summary: NBA Event Frequency Per Game

Based on NBA statistics and game analysis, here's the frequency categorization for basketball events:

### **VERY COMMON** (Happens 20-100+ times per game)
- **Missed 3-Pointer** - ~25-35 per game (teams attempt ~35-40, make ~12-15)
- **Missed Jump Shot** - ~30-40 per game
- **Missed Layup** - ~8-12 per game
- **Defensive Rebound** - ~30-35 per game
- **Offensive Rebound** - ~10-12 per game
- **Turnover** - ~12-15 per game
- **Personal Foul** - ~18-22 per game (most common foul)
- **Out of Bounds** - ~15-20 per game

**Current Status**: These should be **mild** severity, **1 point**, **1 drink**

---

### **COMMON** (Happens 5-20 times per game)
- **Offensive Foul** - ~3-5 per game
- **Traveling** - ~2-4 per game
- **Double Dribble** - ~1-2 per game
- **Shot Clock Violation** - ~2-3 per game
- **Missed Free Throw** - ~8-12 per game (teams shoot ~20-25 FTs, make ~15-18)
- **Charging Foul** - ~2-3 per game
- **Blocking Foul** - ~3-5 per game
- **Shooting Foul** - ~8-12 per game
- **Airball** - ~3-5 per game

**Current Status**: These should be **mild** severity, **1-2 points**, **1 drink**

---

### **MODERATE** (Happens 1-5 times per game)
- **Technical Foul** - ~0.5-1.5 per game (less common than personal fouls)
- **Goaltending** - ~0.5-1 per game
- **Basket Interference** - ~0.2-0.5 per game
- **Illegal Screen** - ~1-2 per game
- **3-Second Violation** - ~1-2 per game
- **Player Dunk** - ~3-6 per game (depends on team)
- **Pick and Roll** - ~15-20 per game (very common, but "missed" version is less)

**Current Status**: These should be **moderate** severity, **3-5 points**, **2 drinks** or **take a shot**

**Note**: Technical Foul is currently **moderate** but should stay moderate because:
- Less frequent than personal fouls (~0.5-1.5 vs 18-22)
- Significant impact (free throw + possession)
- More impactful than common violations

---

### **RARE** (Happens 0.2-1 time per game on average)
- **Flagrant Foul** - ~0.1-0.3 per game (very rare)
- **Flagrant Foul 2** - ~0.05-0.1 per game (extremely rare)
- **Ejection** - ~0.1-0.2 per game
- **Fouled Out** - ~0.2-0.4 per game
- **Buzzer Beater** - ~0.1-0.3 per game (rare, but happens)
- **Game-Winning Buzzer Beater** - ~0.05-0.1 per game (very rare)
- **Half-Court Shot Made** - ~0.05-0.1 per game (extremely rare)
- **Full-Court Shot Made** - ~0.01-0.02 per game (almost never happens)

**Current Status**: These should be **severe** severity, **6-10 points**, **shotgun** or **take 2 shots**

---

### **VERY RARE** (Happens <0.2 times per game, maybe once every few games)
- **Game-Winning Buzzer Beater** - ~0.05-0.1 per game
- **Full-Court Shot Made** - ~0.01-0.02 per game (maybe 1-2 per season league-wide)
- **Flagrant Foul 2** - ~0.05-0.1 per game
- **Ejection** (for serious offenses) - ~0.1-0.2 per game

**Current Status**: These should be **severe** severity, **9-10 points**, **shotgun** or **everyone finishes drink**

---

## Proposed Rebalancing Plan

### Severity Distribution (Based on Rarity)

1. **Mild (60-70% of deck)** - Very Common & Common events
   - Points: 1-2
   - Penalty: "Take a drink"
   - Examples: Missed 3-Pointer, Missed Jump Shot, Personal Foul, Turnover, Defensive Rebound

2. **Moderate (20-30% of deck)** - Moderate frequency events
   - Points: 3-5
   - Penalty: "Take 2 drinks" or "Take a shot"
   - Examples: Technical Foul, Goaltending, Player Dunk, Illegal Screen

3. **Severe (10-15% of deck)** - Rare & Very Rare events
   - Points: 6-10
   - Penalty: "Shotgun a beer" or "Take 2 shots" or "Everyone finishes drink"
   - Examples: Flagrant Foul, Ejection, Buzzer Beater, Game-Winning Buzzer Beater, Half-Court Shot

## Specific Card Adjustments Needed

### Cards to Upgrade (Increase Severity/Points):

1. **Technical Foul** ⚠️ CHECK CURRENT STATUS
   - Should be: **moderate**, **4-5 points**, **"Take 2 drinks"** or **"Take a shot"**
   - Reason: Less frequent than personal fouls (~0.5-1.5 vs 18-22), but more impactful

2. **Flagrant Foul** ⚠️ NEEDS UPGRADE
   - Should be: **severe**, **7-8 points**, **"Shotgun a beer"**
   - Reason: Very rare (~0.1-0.3 per game), serious offense

3. **Flagrant Foul 2** ⚠️ NEEDS UPGRADE
   - Should be: **severe**, **9-10 points**, **"Shotgun a beer"** or **"Everyone finishes drink"**
   - Reason: Extremely rare (~0.05-0.1 per game), results in ejection

4. **Ejection** ⚠️ NEEDS UPGRADE
   - Should be: **severe**, **8-9 points**, **"Shotgun a beer"**
   - Reason: Rare (~0.1-0.2 per game), major game impact

5. **Buzzer Beater** ⚠️ NEEDS UPGRADE
   - Should be: **severe**, **7-8 points**, **"Shotgun a beer"**
   - Reason: Rare (~0.1-0.3 per game), exciting play

6. **Game-Winning Buzzer Beater** ⚠️ NEEDS UPGRADE
   - Should be: **severe**, **9-10 points**, **"Everyone shotguns"** or **"Everyone finishes drink"**
   - Reason: Very rare (~0.05-0.1 per game), game-deciding play

7. **Half-Court Shot Made** ⚠️ NEEDS UPGRADE
   - Should be: **severe**, **8-9 points**, **"Shotgun a beer"**
   - Reason: Extremely rare (~0.05-0.1 per game)

8. **Full-Court Shot Made** ⚠️ NEEDS UPGRADE
   - Should be: **severe**, **10 points**, **"Everyone finishes drink"**
   - Reason: Almost never happens (~0.01-0.02 per game, maybe 1-2 per season league-wide)

### Cards to Keep as Mild (Very Common):

- Missed 3-Pointer
- Missed Jump Shot
- Missed Layup
- Defensive Rebound
- Offensive Rebound
- Turnover
- Personal Foul
- Out of Bounds
- Traveling
- Double Dribble

### Cards That May Need Review:

- **Player Dunk** - Currently check status. Should be moderate if it's a made dunk (3-6 per game), but if it's "missed dunk" it could be mild
- **Pick and Roll** - If it's "missed pick and roll" it should be mild (common), but if it's a successful play it might be different
- **Goaltending** - Should be moderate (rare but happens)
- **Basket Interference** - Should be moderate (rare)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Categorize all 100 basketball cards** by actual game frequency
2. **Adjust severity levels** based on rarity
3. **Adjust point values** to match severity (rarer = more points)
4. **Adjust drink penalties** to match severity (rarer = steeper penalty)
5. **Ensure distribution**: ~60-70% mild, ~20-30% moderate, ~10-15% severe

---

## Priority Adjustments (Immediate Fixes)

### High Priority (Clear Misclassifications):
1. **Flagrant Foul**: Check current → should be severe (7-8 points)
2. **Flagrant Foul 2**: Check current → should be severe (9-10 points)
3. **Ejection**: Check current → should be severe (8-9 points)
4. **Buzzer Beater**: Check current → should be severe (7-8 points)
5. **Game-Winning Buzzer Beater**: Check current → should be severe (9-10 points)
6. **Half-Court Shot Made**: Check current → should be severe (8-9 points)
7. **Full-Court Shot Made**: Check current → should be severe (10 points)

### Medium Priority (Review Needed):
- Review all "moderate" cards to ensure they're truly moderate frequency
- Review all "mild" cards to ensure common events aren't over-penalized
- Ensure rare events (Buzzer Beater, Flagrant Fouls, Ejections) are all severe

### Low Priority (Fine-tuning):
- Adjust point values within severity tiers for better balance
- Ensure penalty descriptions match severity appropriately

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Research complete - Document created
2. ⏳ Review all 100 basketball cards and assign frequency categories
3. ⏳ Recalculate severity, points, and penalties based on rarity
4. ⏳ Update card definitions in `lib/game/cards.ts`
